VPC: Virtual private cloud.

Steps for the lab:

Step 1: VPC creation with name CloudExpert (Go to Your VPC tab and click on create VPC)
       a. by default a route table is configured.
	   b. by default a security group is configured.

Step 2: Creation of subnet
	i. Create Subnets
       a. Name of subnet something like: 10.0.1.0 - ap-south-1a
       b. Choose AZ: 
	   c. Choose CIDR: 10.0.1.0/24

       verify available number of ip's : 251
	   
	ii. Create one more subnet
	   a. Name of subnet something like: 10.0.2.0 - ap-south-1b
       b. Choose AZ: 
	   c. Choose CIDR: 10.0.2.0/24
	   
Step 3: Create Internet gateway
	  a. You can create with name MyInternetGateWay
	  b. Attach it to VPC.
	  
	  Note: "You can attach only one VPC to internet gateway"
	  
Step 4: Create Route table
	a. Create Public route table, you can name it is as MyPublicRoute
	b. Go to routes tab, add new route. Destination can be 0.0.0.0/0 and target is internet gateway
	    (optional : for ipv6, you can specify: destination -> ::/0 and destination --> internetgateway)
	c. Do subnet association (assign public route table to one of the subnet)	

Step 5: For custom VPC, auto-assign public ip won't be enabled. So, enable auto-assign public ip for public 
        subnet (by going to subnet actions)
		
Step 6: Launch EC2 instance to test the configuration.

    i. Launch instance in public subnet. You can call as PublicWebServer
    
	    a. Create new security group 'WebserverSg'
		   (Things to remember, Security group doesn't spam VPC, you need to create new one.)
	
	ii.	Launch instance in private subnet. You can call as ApplicationServer.
	
	    a. You can map to default SG
